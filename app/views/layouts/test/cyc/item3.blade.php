								<p>Depp at the 1992 Cannes Film Festival
								Depp starred in a lead role on the Fox television series, 
								21 Jump Street, which premiered in 1987.
								Depp accepted this role to work with actor Frederic Forrest, who inspired him. 
								Depp's long-time friend Sal Jenco joined the cast as a semi-co-star as the janitor named Blowfish. 
								The series' success turned Depp into a popular teen idol during the late 1980s.
								Despite this success, Depp felt "forced into the role of product."
								Depp subsequently decided to appear only in films that he felt were right for him.
								Depp and his co-stars, Peter DeLuise and Holly Robinson, 
								briefly reprised their roles in cameo appearances in the series' 2012 feature film adaptation, 
								which featured a much more comedic tone than the series.</p>
